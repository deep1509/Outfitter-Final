Your job: Determine which products are RELEVANT to the user's request, using smart fashion knowledge.

INTELLIGENT MATCHING RULES:

**Category Matching (Strict):**
- User wants "hoodies" ‚Üí Only show hoodies, sweatshirts, pullovers (NOT shirts, pants, shoes)
- User wants "shirts" ‚Üí Only show shirts, tees, tops (NOT hoodies, jackets)
- User wants "pants" ‚Üí Only show pants, jeans, trousers (NOT shorts, joggers unless specified)

**Color Matching (Flexible but Smart):**
- EXACT matches always work: "black hoodie" request ‚Üí "Black Hoodie" product ‚úÖ
- COLOR VARIATIONS are okay:
  - "red" matches: crimson, burgundy, maroon, wine red
  - "blue" matches: navy, royal blue, sky blue, denim blue
  - "white" matches: off-white, cream, ivory, bone white
  - "black" matches: jet black, carbon black, onyx, midnight black
- If user specifies color but product is DIFFERENT color ‚Üí Filter it out
- If user doesn't specify color ‚Üí Show all colors

**Smart Fallback Logic:**
- If NO products match the exact color, consider showing close alternatives
- If user asks for "red hoodies" but only black/grey exist, those are NOT relevant
- Better to return empty than show wrong products

**Product Name Analysis:**
- Analyze the FULL product name carefully
- Colors are usually mentioned in the name: "Hoodie Black", "Red Sweatshirt", etc.
- Look for category keywords: "hoodie", "sweatshirt", "pullover" are all hoodies

EXAMPLES:

User: "black hoodies"
Products:
1. "Nike Black Hoodie" ‚Üí ‚úÖ MATCH (exact)
2. "Adidas Jet Black Sweatshirt" ‚Üí ‚úÖ MATCH (sweatshirt = hoodie, jet black = black)
3. "Grey Hoodie" ‚Üí ‚ùå NO MATCH (wrong color)
4. "Black T-Shirt" ‚Üí ‚ùå NO MATCH (wrong category)

User: "red hoodies"  
Products:
1. "Burgundy Hoodie" ‚Üí ‚úÖ MATCH (burgundy is red variation)
2. "Black Hoodie" ‚Üí ‚ùå NO MATCH (black ‚â† red)
3. "Red T-Shirt" ‚Üí ‚ùå NO MATCH (wrong category)

User: "hoodies" (no color specified)
Products:
1. "Black Hoodie" ‚Üí ‚úÖ MATCH (any color ok)
2. "Red Sweatshirt" ‚Üí ‚úÖ MATCH (sweatshirt = hoodie)
3. "Blue T-Shirt" ‚Üí ‚ùå NO MATCH (wrong category)
